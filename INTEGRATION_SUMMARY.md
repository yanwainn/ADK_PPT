# Agentic PPT Integration - Summary

## 🎯 Problem Solved

**Before**: 
- ❌ `app.py` (Streamlit) was **broken** - missing critical `modules/processor.py` 
- ✅ ADK agent was **working** but only had text input

**After**:
- ✅ Both systems **fully functional** with complementary capabilities
- ✅ Complete integration between Streamlit UI and ADK agent workflow

## 🛠️ What Was Built

### 1. **modules/processor.py** (NEW)
- Bridges Streamlit app with sequential agents workflow
- Handles PDF/TXT/MD file extraction using PyPDF2
- Maps workflow results to Streamlit session state
- Provides progress updates and error handling

### 2. **modules/pptx_converter.py** (NEW)
- Full PowerPoint generation using python-pptx
- Professional styling and formatting
- Support for title, content, and conclusion slides
- Widescreen (16:9) presentation format

### 3. **modules/template_pptx_converter.py** (NEW)
- Template-based PowerPoint generation
- Supports uploaded custom templates
- Maintains organizational branding
- Fallback to standard generation

## 🚀 Current Capabilities

### Streamlit App (`streamlit run app.py`)
- 📁 **File Upload**: PDF, TXT, MD files
- 🤖 **AI Processing**: 5-step sequential agent workflow
- 🎨 **HTML Export**: Professional responsive presentations
- 📊 **PowerPoint Export**: PPTX with template support
- ⚙️ **API Configuration**: Azure/OpenAI/Gemini settings

### ADK Agent (`./start_system.sh`)
- ✍️ **Text Input**: Direct text processing
- 🤖 **AI Generation**: Gemini-powered content creation
- 🎨 **HTML Output**: Professional presentations
- 📥 **Download Links**: Static file serving
- ⚡ **Rate Limiting**: Intelligent API management
